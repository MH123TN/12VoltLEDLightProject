# 12VoltLEDLightProject
This is a 12 Volt LED Light Project - more of a hardware build and tinker than software but just as good a place as any
These lights make use of glass jars and 12 volt LED light products - build replacement, and LEDS 12 volt arrays
Power is applied using RCA jacks and power distribution is via sterio cables from 12 volt adapters with RCA jacks
or one of many 12 volt battery packs built with a 12 volt jack.
This is a prepardness item.
We have frequent storms and power outages
